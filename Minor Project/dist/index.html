                    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500 text-xl">The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna
                        River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar
                        Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj
                        Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of
                        Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of
                        solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further
                        increases the aesthetic aspect.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500 text-xl">The uniqueness of Taj Mahal lies in some truly remarkable
                        innovations carried out by the horticulture planners and architects of Shah Jahan. One such
                        genius planning is the placing of tomb at one end of the quadripartite garden rather than in the
                        exact centre, which added rich depth and perspective to the distant view of the monument. The
                        most impressive in the Taj Mahal complex next to the tomb, is the main gate which stands
                        majestically in the centre of the southern wall of the forecourt. The gate is flanked on the
                        north front by double arcade galleries. The garden in front of the galleries is subdivided into
                        four quarters by two main walk-ways and each quarters in turn subdivided by the narrower
                        cross-axial walkways, on the Timurid-Persian scheme of the walled in garden. The enclosure walls
                        on the east and west have a pavilion at the centre.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500 text-xl">The massive edifice of Hawa Mahal stands at the intersection
                        of the main road in Jaipur, Badi Chaupad and was built by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh in the
                        year 1799. Hawa Mahal derives its name from its unique structure, which is a mesh of small
                        windows that allowed cool wind to enter the palace and hence kept the palace comfortable during
                        the hot summer months. The main reason behind the palace's construction was to allow the women
                        of the royal house to observe the festivities on the streets whilst being unseen from the
                        outside as was the custom of the land. It is located right on the edge of the City Palace Jaipur
                        and extends right to the 'zenana'.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500 text-xl">Hawa Mahal is a structure made of red and pink sandstone and
                        has a pyramidal structure which almost resembles a crown. It has been embellished with 953 tiny
                        windows, also known as 'Jharokhas' and embellished with gorgeous latticework. From within, the
                        Hawa Mahal palace is based on five floors each of which has a uniquely decorated chamber. A
                        charming fountain welcomes you inside the main palace, from whereon you can make your way up to
                        the different floors. The top of the palace offers a brilliant view of the City Palace, Jantar
                        Mantar and the ever-busy Siredeori Bazar. There is a small museum as well which holds some rich
                        relics and miniature paintings.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500 text-xl">As one traverses the length and breadth of Gujarat, one
                        constantly stumbles across architectural legacies of the 'Solanki' rule. You keep coming across,
                        living spaces and monuments of another time, offering an eclectic glimpse of the artistic and
                        ingenious beauty that makes this exotically state vibrant. A soothing drive amidst green
                        farmlands just 25 km away from Mehsana on the way to the temples of goddess Bahucharaji reposes
                        the village of Modhera. Set along the backdrop of River Pushpavati, surrounded by a terra-formed
                        garden of flowering trees and songs of birds, rests the famed Sun temple of Modhera.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500 text-xl">As you relax and soothe your nerves, become one with nature
                        and open your mind to the poetry in stone, dedicated to the sun god, living glimpses of the era
                        far elapsed emerge out of the intricacies of narrative sculptures. The remains of the Sun
                        Temples at Modhera are relics of times gone by when reverence of the natural elements fire, air,
                        earth, water and sky were at their peak sharing space with myriad manifestations of Vedic gods.
                        The ancient philosophy venerating natural elements and its association with humans was
                        considered the prime force and energy of the life cycle. A walk around the serene temple campus
                        makes you aware of the positively strong aura of energy which the place radiates and through it
                        brings one closer to the environs.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500 text-xl">Hampi, the city of ruins, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
                        Situated in the shadowed depth of hills and valleys in the state of Karnataka, this place is a
                        historical delight for travellers. Surrounded by 500 ancient monuments, beautiful temples,
                        bustling street markets, bastions, treasury building and captivating remains of Vijayanagar
                        Empire, Hampi is a backpacker's delight. Hampi is an open museum with 100+ locations to explore
                        and a favourite way to see the city from the perspective of its history.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500 text-xl">Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagar empire around 1500
                        AD, and by some accounts, the second largest city in the world at that time. Over the next
                        centuries it fell out of importance, and now you can explore the ruins of a lot of temples and
                        other structures spread out over a vast area. The terrain around Hampi is as mysterious as the
                        ruins itself - the city is surrounded by boulders of different sizes, and you can climb to the
                        top of them with a little effort to get a stunning view of the entire city and the geography. It
                        is located on the banks of the Tungabhadra River.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500 text-xl">Located near the City Palace in the regal city of Jaipur,
                        Jantar Mantar is the largest stone astronomical observatory in the world. Owing to its rich
                        cultural, heritage and scientific value, Jantar Mantar in Jaipur has also been featured on
                        UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites. This ancient study boasts of nineteen instruments built
                        out of stone and brass and was built by Raja Sawai Jai Singh in 1727-33. The intelligent
                        construction and placement of these instruments allowed the observers to note the position of
                        heavenly bodies with their naked eye alone. Time has failed to lay dust upon this engineering
                        marvel and it still works as well as it used to in the olden times.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500 text-xl">The main objective of building this vast observatory was to
                        study and gather information about space and time. The instruments here pertain to the Egyptian
                        study of Ptolemaic astronomy and follows three classical celestial coordinates to track the
                        positions of heavenly bodies- namely the horizon-zenith local system, the equatorial system and
                        the ecliptic system. Another fact that makes this destination unique is that the world's largest
                        sundial is situated here. The observatory in Jaipur is a part of a collection of five other such
                        observatories built by Raja Jai Singh, which are located in New Delhi, Ujjain, Varanasi and
                        Mathura. The best experience here is undoubtedly the light and sound show that takes place every
                        evening and Jantar Mantar lights up like a firefly!</p>

                    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500 text-xl">One of the most spiritual places in India, the Golden Temple,
                        also known as Sri Harmandir Sahib, is the holiest shrine in all of Sikhism. Located right in the
                        heart of Amritsar, the stunning golden architecture of the temple and the daily Langar
                        (community kitchen) attract a large number of visitors and devotees each day. The temple is open
                        to devotees of all faiths and serves over 100,000 people free food from all walks of life.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500 text-xl">The main Temple housing the shrine is a small part of the
                        vast complex known as Harmandir Sahib or Darbar Sahib to the Sikhs. The spiritual focus is the
                        tank, the Amrit Sarovar, which surrounds the glistening central shrine. Around the edges of the
                        compound, there are more shrines and monuments. The Sikh Museum is located inside the main
                        entrance clock tower which shows the oppression endured by the Sikhs at the hands of the
                        Mughals, the British and the Indian Government of 1984. The Ramgarhia Bunga is a protective
                        fortress located at the southeast end of the tank and is surrounded by two Islamic-style
                        minarets. Golden Temple is indisputably one of the most exquisite attractions in the world.</p>

                        Heritage Sites and are quite popular among travelers worldwide. Ajanta Caves, located around
                        99km north of Aurangabad, are mostly Buddhist sites and were used as a retreat by Buddhist
                        Monks. Ellora is just 15 km west of Aurangabad and has a better mix of Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist
                        sites. These hand-carved caves were built and sponsored by the Indian rulers of those periods
                        and almost buried by thick forests. One of the most famous places in the entire Ajanta and
                        Ellora Caves is the Kailash Temple, which is also the single most massive monolithic structure
                        globally. These rock-cut caves containing carvings are some of the best examples of ancient
                        Indian architecture and sculpture.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500 text-xl">The Cellular Jail, also known as 'Kala Pani' is an old
                        colonial prison situated in Port Blair, the capital of Andaman and Nicobar islands. Constructed
                        by the Britishers during their colonial rule in India, the jail was used particularly to exile
                        Indian political prisoners. It was used to house many notable freedom fighters such as
                        Batukeshwar Dutt, Yogendra Shukla and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-500 text-xl">The jail complex is now owned by the Government of India and
                        it is recognised as the national memorial monument that showcases the life of prisoners during
                        the British era. Cellular Jail stands as a prominent tourist attraction in the Andaman and
                        Nicobar Islands where visitors can learn about its history and also enjoy a light show held in
                        memory of all the prisoners who were imprisoned here.</p>
